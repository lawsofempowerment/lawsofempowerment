            <h2>The Ten Laws</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Golden Foundation:</strong> Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Dignity Through Compassion:</strong> Every person deserves respect, regardless of belief, status, or past.</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Belief, Unity of Principle:</strong> All are free to believe and practice without coercion, united by compassion.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose-Driven Education:</strong> Discover and nurture individual strengths through intentional learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Restorative Justice and Humane Protection:</strong> Reform is the priority, but safety comes first. Redemption is always possible.</li>
                <li><strong>AI as Ally, Not Master:</strong> AI exists to serve the highest values of humanityâ€”empathy, growth, healing, and truth.</li>
                <li><strong>Success is Service:</strong> The measure of greatness is in lifting others, not accumulating for oneself.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing the Broken:</strong> Confront pain with care, structure, and real support. No one is beyond help unless they choose to be.</li>
                <li><strong>Belief Shapes Reality:</strong> What we believe, we begin to create. Purpose begins in the mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment is the Mission:</strong> We are here to empower one another, to awaken, to guide, and to light the path forward.</li>
